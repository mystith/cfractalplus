## welcome
this is my CUDA GPU accelerated fractal generation program i made in C++ using NVIDIA's CUDA toolkit. it supports the mandelbrot set, the julia set and the burning ship fractal.

syntax:
```
cfractalplus [type (0: mandelbrot, 1: julia set, 2: burning ship)] [width] [height] [pan x] [pan y] [max iteration] [zoom] [c] [block size x] [block size y] [cpu? 0: no, 1: yes]
```

quite a mouthful, i know
